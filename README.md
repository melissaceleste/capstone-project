## Coucou!👋🏽

coucou! is your partner in crime when struggeling with questions and thoughts like:

- "What should I wear today?"
- "I have nothing to wear!"
- "Do I have a matching top to this cute new jeans?"

💫 You can carry your whole closet in your pocket by saving all your clothings in this app. 📷
💫 Coucou! shows your long forgotten pieces randomly.
💫 You can swipe through your closet, add new pieces and plan your outfit.
